Routing custom top-level domains (e.g. my-custom-domain.com) and custom subdomains (e.g. blog.my-custom-domain.com) to an app running on a Cloud Foundry instance can be achieved using CloudFlare as a DNS provider as follows:
Hosting an application on a Cloud Foundry instance Sign up for an account with a Cloud Foundry provider (e.g. Pivotal Web Services) and the install the Cloud Foundry CLI.</description></item><item><title>Middleman and Cloud Foundry</title><link>https://robdimsdale.com/blog/2015-01-11-middleman-and-cloudfoundry/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdimsdale.com/blog/2015-01-11-middleman-and-cloudfoundry/</guid><description>Middleman is a static site generator; Cloud Foundry is a Platform as a Service.
Deploying a Middleman static site to Cloud Foundry can be achieved in two ways:
building the site and pushing the resultant static files configuring Middleman to integrate with a Rack-enabled webserver and pushing everything. Serving static files is more efficient than running a Rack-enabled webserver, and additionally will not require any extra files or configuration. It is therefore the preferred option.</description></item><item><title>WL</title><link>https://robdimsdale.com/projects/wl/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:33:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdimsdale.com/projects/wl/</guid><description>Unofficial Wunderlist API client library and CLI, written in golang.</description></item><item><title>Garagepi</title><link>https://robdimsdale.com/projects/garagepi/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:33:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdimsdale.com/projects/garagepi/</guid><description>A webserver written in golang to display the output of a Raspberry Pi camera module and trigger gpio.

Built with Spring Web MVC and Spring for Android, and uses Gradle as the build tool.
It behaves like a browser, interacting with the website the same way a human would. Therefore it is likely to break if/when the website changes. It is only useful to those with accounts with Equity Apartments, as a valid log-in is required.</description></item></channel></rss>

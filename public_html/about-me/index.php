    <p>I'm Rob Dimsdale, a software developer currently based near San Francisco where I work for <a href="http://www.gopivotal.com/">Pivotal</a> in the <a href="http://www.gopivotal.com/platform-as-a-service/pivotal-cf">Cloud Foundry</a> project. Previously I have worked for <a href="http://www.oracle.com">Oracle</a> in the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/servers-storage/storage/tape-storage/overview/index.html">Tape Storage</a> division and <a href="http://www.softwire.com">Softwire</a> in London, UK.</p>
    <p>Whilst my primary focus to date has been Java web applications with a decent dose of systems-administration, I'm interested in all sorts of languages and frameworks. At the low-level I've worked on embedded C projects and hardware and at the opposite end I'm working on projects using interpreted languages including Ruby, Python and MATLAB.</p>

    <p>I'm Rob Dimsdale, a software developer currently based near Boulder, CO, where I work for <a href="http://www.oracle.com">Oracle</a> in the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/servers-storage/storage/tape-storage/overview/index.html">Tape Storage</a> division (yes that business is still going and is in fact quite healthy). Prior to moving to the US I worked for <a href="http://www.softwire.com">Softwire</a> in London, UK.</p>
    <p>Whilst my primary focus to date has been Java web applications with a decent dose of systems-administration, I'm interested in all sorts of languages and frameworks. At the low-level I've worked on embedded C projects and hardware and at the opposite end I'm working on projects using scripting languages including Python and MATLAB.</p>

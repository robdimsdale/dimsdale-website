    <h3>Rentchecker</h3>
    <p>Java command-line and android app to check rent owed at <a href="http://myequityapartments.com">myequityapartments.com</a></p>
    <p>Built with Spring Web MVC and Spring for Android, and uses Gradle as the build tool.</p>
    <p>It behaves like a browser, interacting with the website the same way a human would. Therefore it is likely to break if/when the website changes. It is only useful to those with accounts with Equity Apartments, as a valid log-in is required.</p>

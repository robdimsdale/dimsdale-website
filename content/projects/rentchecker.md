Java command-line and android app to check rent owed at [myequityapartments.com](http://myequityapartments.com)

Built with Spring Web MVC and Spring for Android, and uses Gradle as the build tool.

It behaves like a browser, interacting with the website the same way a human would. Therefore it is likely to break if/when the website changes. It is only useful to those with accounts with Equity Apartments, as a valid log-in is required.
